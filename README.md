# Yoga Journey

This project was created as part of my AI and Society class, where we explored the newest AI tools and prompt engineering techniques. 

The concept and prompt for this project were designed by me and generated using Google Gemini, demonstrating how AI can be used creatively to build interactive and engaging web experiences.

The project is a Van Gogh-inspired Chakra Yoga Journey, combining visual art styles with mindfulness practices.
